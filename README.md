Want design, content, and ux feedback on your web project? Open an issue and I'll look for simple and creative ways to improve it or help it stand out. In 5ish minutes.


## The YouTubes

I post these 5(ish) minute videos on YouTube. If you'd prefer yours to be private I am more than happy to do that. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtD0K2KQF24tYn_TCbLPFCE9JneBWSAQM) has all the public FMF videos I've done thus far.


## Things I can provide feedback on

- Websites
- Bootstrapped products
- SaaS apps
- Videos of sweet breakdancing moves
- Copywriting of almost any kind
- Anything 80s/90s related
- Annual family brag letters
- Homemade cookies
- Twitter bios
- Keynote slides
- Backsquat form
- Rob Lowe impressions

## Things I cannot provide feedback on

Country music lyrics, probably.

## How to get the most out of this

Make sure to specify what area of your project needs feedback the most. It may be design, branding, layout, typography, you name it. But if you don't point me in the best the direction, I'll just comment on whatever stands out the most to me.
